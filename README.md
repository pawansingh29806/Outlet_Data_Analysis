# Data Cleaning
First, we have to cross-check each column that the data is correct or not.In the Gender column, we have four unique entries ‘Men’, ‘M’, ‘Women’, and ‘W’.
We have to convert all the ‘M’ to ‘Men’ and ‘W’ to ‘Women’ using the Find and Replace option in the home tab.In Qty. column, we have some numeric values like 1, 2, 3, etc., and some alphabetic values like one and two.Use the Find and Replace option again to replace these alphabetical values with numeric ones.
# Data Processing In this step, we are calculating some data which help us in the analysis.
# Insights

Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh are the top 3 states (~35%).
The Adult age group (30–49 yrs) is max contributed (~50%).
